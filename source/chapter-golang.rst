Introduction

Please go to the main index for the content pages for network computing.

I don't feel like writing a chapter introducing Go right now, as there are other materials already available. There are several tutorials on the Go web site:

- Getting started
- A Tutorial for the Go Programming Language
- Effective Go

There is an introductory textbook on Go: "Go Programming" by John P. Baugh available from Amazon

There is a #golang group on Google+
